module Authlogic
  module Session # :nodoc:
    # This is the most important class in Authlogic. You will inherit this class
    # for your own eg. `UserSession`.
    #
    # Code is organized topically. Each topic is represented by a module. So, to
    # learn about password-based authentication, read the `Password` module.
    #
    # It is common for methods (.initialize and #credentials=, for example) to
    # be implemented in multiple mixins. Those methods will call `super`, so the
    # order of `include`s here is important.
    #
    # Also, to fully understand such a method (like #credentials=) you will need
    # to mentally combine all of its definitions. This is perhaps the primary
    # disadvantage of topical organization using modules.
    #
    # # Ongoing consolidation of modules
    #
    # As described above, a chain of half-a-dozen `super`s is hard to follow.
    # So, we are consolidating all modules into this class. When we are done,
    # there will only be this one file. It will be quite large, but it will
    # be easier to trace execution.
    #
    # Once consolidation is complete, we hope to identify and extract
    # collaborating objects. For example, there may be a "session adapter" that
    # connects this class with the existing `ControllerAdapters`. Perhaps a
    # data object or a state machine will reveal itself.
